# Rename eBooks and PDFs

Use books-manager subagent to rename eBooks and PDFs in current directory to match standardized naming conventions and organize them into individual book directories. Do not categorize books into domain categories.

Requirements:

- Create metadata report (`books_info.yml`) with extracted book information
- Use filesystem MCP if needed for file operations
