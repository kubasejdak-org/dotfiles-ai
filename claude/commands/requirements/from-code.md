# Generate Requirements from Existing Code

Use @requirements-specialist subagent to reverse-engineer requirements from existing codebases, analyzing public APIs, interfaces, and implemented functionality to create structured software requirements.

Requirements:

- Analyze existing codebase structure, public APIs, and interfaces
- Extract functional behavior and business logic from implementation
- Generate structured requirements document using @shared/templates/requirements.md format
- Map code features to functional requirements (FR-), performance aspects to non-functional requirements (NFR-), and technology choices to technical requirements (TR-)
- Ensure all requirements meet professional quality standards (specific, achievable, relevant, testable, unambiguous)
- Create comprehensive Project Overview section based on codebase analysis
- Focus on public API contracts and user-facing functionality rather than internal implementation details

Examples:

- Generate requirements for undocumented legacy modules
- Create formal requirements for existing API endpoints
- Document business rules embedded in code logic
- Extract requirements from working prototypes or MVP implementations
